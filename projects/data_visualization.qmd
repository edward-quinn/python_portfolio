```{python}

import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as plt


```



```{python}

df = (
    pl.read_csv("death_rates.csv")
    .with_columns(pl.col("Year")
    .cast(pl.Utf8)
    .str.to_date(format="%Y"))
)

```




```{python}

df.head()

```

The `year` column is an integer. Make a new column where the year is a date time.


Now make a single line chart for all leading causes of death.

```{python}

sns.lineplot(data = df, x = 'Year', y = 'Age Adjusted Death Rate', hue = 'Cause')

```
