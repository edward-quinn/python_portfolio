```{python}
#| include: false

import polars as pl
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as plt
from mplstyle import mplstyle_from_brand
from brand_yml import Brand

from pyprojroot.here import here

mplstyle_from_brand(here("_brand.yml"))

```



```{python}

df = (
    pl.read_csv(here("projects/death_rates/death_rates.csv"))
    .with_columns(pl.col("Year")
    .cast(pl.Utf8)
    .str.to_date(format="%Y"))
)

```




```{python}

df.head()

```

The `year` column is an integer. Make a new column where the year is a date time.


Now make a single line chart for all leading causes of death.

```{python}

sns.lineplot(data = df, x = 'Year', y = 'Age Adjusted Death Rate', hue = 'Cause')

```

To make sure the _brand.yml style is applied to the matplotlib style sheet, see this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U48y0_yzEPY.
